Each file focuses on one election but includes the results for the previous election for that geographic record.

You are likely to find a few miscellaneous differences due to any of the following:

a) some votes may be included in the state total but not detailed by county (generally for overseas votes and for AK which does not have counties)

b) units are merged/created between elections

c) differences may occur due to the way in which votes for minor party candidates/write-ins/scattering are reported/treated.

d) a slight difference exists between the national totals for the 2000 election in the 1996-2000 and 2000-2004 files: these are due to the inclusion of about 1,000 scattering votes in the 2000-2004 file which were not included in the 1996-2000 file (see AK and HI).
